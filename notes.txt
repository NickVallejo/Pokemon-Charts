1. Filter will not call again after a search. This is because the filter is the same as the last call.
2. Don't call the resultData() func when the filter changes, call it when the button is pressed
3. currently, the button being pressed is what triggers the setFilter(), by passing in mockFilter
4. throw away mockfilter and just update the fitler as things are being added and removed
5. Make the button press call resultData(), don't make the filter being set call resultData()
